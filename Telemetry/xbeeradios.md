# Digi Xbee Radio Signals

This guide explains how to set up two Digi Xbee radio modules to send and receive messages, both using the Digi XCTU software and with a simple Python script.

## 1. Install Digi XCTU

Digi XCTU is the official configuration and testing software for Digi Xbee radios.

- **Download XCTU:** [https://hub.digi.com/support/products/xctu/](https://hub.digi.com/support/products/xctu/)
- Install it on **both computers** that will have Xbee modules plugged in.

## 2. Connect Xbee Modules

1. Plug each Xbee radio module into its USB adapter or development board.
2. Connect one module to **Computer A** and the other to **Computer B**.
3. Launch XCTU on both computers.
