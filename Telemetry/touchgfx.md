# TouchGFX
TouchGFX is the software we use to help us design and interact with the display for the driver.

Download TouchGFX Version 4.25.0 here: [Touchgfx](https://support.touchgfx.com/4.25/docs/introduction/installation)
Be sure to follow the instructions, as you need to download not only TouchGFX but also STM32Cube in order for it to work.

Our current wheelboard is a Riverdi STM32 Embedded Display, and when testing the display, make sure to properly connect the necessary pins. A pin layout guide can be found here: [Layout Doc](https://download.riverdi.com/RVT50HQSFWN00/DS_RVT50HQSFWN00_Rev.1.1.pdf)
