# Aerobody and Composites Subteam

The Aerobody and Composites subteam designs an aerodynamically efficient outer shell for the Solar Car. The subteam uses advanced CAD modeling and Computational Fluid Dynamics to create an aerodynamic body with functional features and mechanisms, integrating mechanical and electrical components within the car. During the manufacturing process, the subteam creates lightweight composite parts to build the outershell.
