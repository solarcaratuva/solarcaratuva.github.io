This section contains information on how to install the necessary software for working with GitHub.

## Windows
A popular option for using GitHub on Windows is Git Bash because it provides an easy to use CLI for pulling from and committing to the repo. 
The link to download Git Bash can be found [here](https://gitforwindows.org/).
## Linux
Almost all, if not all, Linux distributions either have git preinstalled or have implementations of Git in their package repositories. This can be installed using your distributions package manager.
For Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint, it can be installed using `$ sudo apt install git`
For Arch-based distributions, Git is installed using `$ sudo pacman -S git`
## Mac
Mac users should first install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager for OSX. Then, Git can be installed using `$ brew install git`.
