# Projects

The various projects of the Embedded Subteam. 

## Embedded Codebase

The Embedded Codebase is the code that is compiled and uploaded to the Solar Car. This is the subteam's primary project every year. There is a separate codebase for each design cycle, each of which are linked below. 

### Current Design Cycle

[**Rivanna3** (2024-present)](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/Rivanna3), [Telemetry WheelBoard Display](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/Rivanna3_Telemetry_Display)


### Previous Design Cycles

[**Rivanna2S** (2022-2024)](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/Rivanna2S)

[**Rivanna2** (2021-2022)](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/Rivanna2), [Gauge Cluster](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/gauge-cluster)


## Supporting Projects

These projects are separate from the Embedded Codebase, and are not uploaded to the car. These projects support the team in various ways, such as debugging. They are linked below.

[CAN Message Logger](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/CANMessageLogger) <br>
This program is for logging, filtering, and analyzing recorded or live CAN messages. It is intended to be a one-stop-shop for CAN message based debugging and analysis.

TODO: Fall 2024 - Spring 2025 project

[CAN Message Generator](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/CAN-Message-Generator) <br>
This program generates mock CAN messages for debugging.

[Hardware-in-loop testing](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/HiL_Testing) <br>
This project is the code for a test server used to thoroughly test the Embedded Codebase. The testing server emulates all the inputs into the physical testing board, and analyzes the outputs to determine if the code is working correctly. 

TODO: Fall 2024 - Spring 2025 project

[Onboarding Installer Script](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/Onboarding_Installer) <br>
This script downloads, installs, and configures the necessary software stack to develop, compile, and upload our embedded code to the car.

[CAN Messages Definitions](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/CAN-messages) <br>
This repo contains the `*.dbc` definitions of our various CAN messages.

[Team Wiki (this website)](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/solarcaratuva.github.io) <br>
The markdown source code for this wiki is found here. 


## Telemetry Legacy Codebase

[Repo Link](https://github.com/solarcaratuva/Telemetry) <br>
This is the legacy JavaScript-based codebase used by the Telemetry subteam from 2019-2024.
